## 💡 Requirements

- macOS 10.13 (High Sierra) or newer  
- Admin privileges (Terminal will prompt for your login password)  
- Must be run in **Terminal**

---

## 🧪 How to Run the Script

1. **Double-click** the `.sh` file once to let macOS verify it  
   *(System Preferences → Security & Privacy → General may prompt you to allow it)*

2. Open **Terminal** (`⌘ + Space`, then type `Terminal`)

3. Make the script executable:
   ```bash
   chmod +x <drag script file into Terminal>
   ```

4. Run the script:
   ```bash
   Double click the program and you're good to go.
   ```

5. When prompted for your password, enter the password you use to log in to your Mac (nothing will appear as you type — that's normal)

✅ Done — the script is ready to use!

> 💡 Tip: After the initial chmod step, you can just double-click the file in Finder to launch it like an app.

## 🛡️ Why Use It?

If your Mac is slow, cluttered, or acting up, this script gives you a clean, consistent way to troubleshoot and maintain it — with no bloat, no third-party GUIs, and no technical experience required.

Great for personal users, IT support, and field techs alike.
